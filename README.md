# Key Lock Box Control
 Estate agents or rental companies could use this system to control access to keys for houses and premises. A key could be placed in a lock box outside a premises.  An authorised person would logon to the website hosted by the Linux system.  A code would be issued that would allow the lock-box to be opened via a keypad.  The server would control the duration of the code remotely. 
#### This project is expected to be completed in May 2023
