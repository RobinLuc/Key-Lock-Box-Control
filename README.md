# Key Lock Box Control
This project implements a web server on an Arduino.  This system will interface with sensors and other embedded hardware attached to a microcontroller based development board.  This Linux board and the microcontroller will communicate wirelessly.  
The system will have client software that will run in a browser; this will use HTML and JavaScript to implement its functionality.  Server software that will run in the Linux board will serve up the webpages to the client machines.  This server software can be implemented in JavaScript using a Node.js framework.
The communications between the Linux machine and the clientâ€™s browser can be implemented in HTTP and use the "socket.io" JavaScript library.  
The communications between the microcontroller boards and the Linux machine use Bluetooth.  
#### This project is expected to be completed in May 2023
